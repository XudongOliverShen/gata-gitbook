**Building increasingly powerful AI systems (i.e., AGI and superintelligence) is the most important technical problem of our time.** This pursuit has already reshaped every corner of technology, from vision, language, to robotics.

**The radical rise of AI creates opportunities for adjacent sectors to outcompete well-established incumbents by focusing on the AI frontier.** Rapid frontier innovation erodes the competitive edge of incumbents who struggle to pivot quickly. In this dynamic environment, smaller, specialized teams with a clear mission can move faster, capture market share, and leapfrog slower-moving giants.

**We are already witnessing a realignment of the tech landscape driven by frontier AI.** OpenAI and Anthropic have already disrupted traditional search engines. New cloud-service providers challenge AWS, Microsoft, and Google by optimizing for foundation model workloads. Groq develops specialized chips for foundation models. Meanwhile, companies focused on frontier AI advancement prediction ([Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai)), frontier AI evaluation ([METR](https://metr.org)), frontier AI risk mitigation ([Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org), [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai)), and frontier AI safety and security ([Gray Swan AI](https://www.grayswan.ai)) are emerging.

**We believe that focusing on frontier data presents Gata a disruptive opportunity for the AI data industry.** Most data companies operate on an outsourcing model, responding to AI companiesâ€™ data demands. They are poised to follow frontier advancements. In contrast, Gata aims to proactively research and produce frontier data that unlocks frontier-level AI advancements. In doing so, Gata drives frontier AI advancements.
