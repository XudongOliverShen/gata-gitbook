* We have scaled over 5.3M real-user ChatGPT data, representing the largest publicly available human-AI interaction dataset outside of OpenAI. This dataset is highly valuable because (1) it captures real-world use cases and provide deep insights into how AI can better understand and respond to human needs, intentions, and complexities, and (2) ChatGPT is widely recognized as the best AI service.

* We have scaled over 106k real-user o1 reasoning data, representing the largest publicly available AI reasoning dataset outside of OpenAI. Reasoning AI, often referred to as test-time scaling, represents a new paradigm for enhancing AI capabilities. It has become a primary focus for nearly all leading AI research labs. OpenAI's o1 and o3 reasoning data enable imitation and distillation learning, facilitating the development of other advanced reasoning AI systems.
