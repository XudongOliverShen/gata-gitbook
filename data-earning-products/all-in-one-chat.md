When using ChatGPT, you may have noticed that it sometimes generates two responses simultaneously and nudges you to select your preferred one (above screenshot is an example). This subtle process allows OpenAI to collect human preference data, which is fundamental for human-AI alignment‚Äîessentially enabling AI to produce outputs that better align with human desires. This approach is a key component of OpenAI‚Äôs data flywheel.

Gata offers a subsidized All-in-One Chat service that makes contributing your preferences effortless and rewarding. For every question you ask, you receive three distinct responses from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Selecting your preferred response becomes a natural part of the interaction, allowing you to contribute valuable preference data without added effort.

The more you chat, the more you earn. Points accumulated from your interactions can be redeemed for advanced AI subscriptions, creating a seamless system where your engagement drives both human-AI alignment and tangible rewards.

## 3. Key Features

* **Diverse AI Perspectives**: Receive three responses from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini at once‚Äîeliminate AI bias and gain 3x insights.
* **Natural Human Preference Data Contribution**: The user experience is designed to seamlessly integrate human preference data contribution into the chat process: when continuing the chat, users have to select their preferred response, which is added to the chat history, while unselected responses are removed. This design incentivizes truthful preference selection. By doing so, users automatically contribute valuable human preference data while they chat, which is critical for advancing human-AI alignment.
* **Earn as You Chat**: A positive feedback loop ensures the more you chat, the more human preference data you contribute, and the more rewards you earn, creating a seamless blend of productivity and incentivization.
