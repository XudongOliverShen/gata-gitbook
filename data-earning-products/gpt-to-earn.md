## 1. Introduction

**GPT-to-Earn** is a Chrome extension designed to reward ChatGPT users for sharing their conversation data in exchange for Gata points. It seamlessly integrates into the user’s ChatGPT workflow, providing a simple and rewarding experience.

## 2. Motivation

ChatGPT data is among the most valuable forms of human-AI interaction data. On the human side, it represents the largest AI user community, with interactions that capture real-world use cases and provide deep insights into how AI can better understand and respond to human needs, intentions, and complexities. On the AI side, this data showcases the most advanced AI outputs in the wild. This wealth of data has been a cornerstone of OpenAI's development, providing a significant competitive advantage by enabling the refinement and enhancement of AI models.

However, while users create this valuable data, they have traditionally not been involved in its monetization or rewarded for their contributions. GPT-to-Earn seeks to bridge this gap by empowering users to voluntarily share their ChatGPT data in exchange for Gata point rewards. It not only ensures a fairer value exchange for individual users but also provides a significant opportunity for AI companies to close the gap with OpenAI by leveraging high-quality, real-world human-AI interaction data.

## 3. Key Features

1. **Chat as Usual**: Users chat with ChatGPT as they normally would, conducting conversations on any topic of interest.
2. **Access GPT-to-Earn**: After completing their chat, users open the Gata Chrome extension, which displays their ChatGPT conversation history.
3. **Select and Share**: Users review their conversations, select those they wish to share, and confirm sharing.
