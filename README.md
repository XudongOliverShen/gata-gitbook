# Gata: Co-Create Frontier AI Data



<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Êà™Â±è2025-01-20 ‰∏äÂçà1.04.06.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Gata aims to become a decentralized version of** [**LAION**](https://laion.ai)**, focused on researching and producing frontier data necessary to unlock frontier-level AI advancements. By using token-based incentives, Gata can rapidly translate frontier AI research into large-scale data production.**

## Our Thesis

**Read our thesis on why Gata focuses on frontier data (**[**here**](thesis/why-frontier-data.md) **and** [**here**](thesis/frontier-is-disruptive.md)**), Below are the key points:**

* Despite data being widely recognized as the fossil fuel of AI, most data companies capture only the marginal value of data. They passively respond to AI companies‚Äô data demands and provide data labeling as a service. AI companies capture most of the value by driving data innovation in-house while outsourcing data production.
* Gata takes a different approach by proactively researching frontier data that advance frontier AI and address critical challenges. By innovating with and owning frontier data, Gata aims to capture a share of frontier AI's value through data.
* While most data companies follow frontier AI advancements, through frontier data, Gata seeks to drive frontier AI advancements.
* Focusing on frontier data presents a disruptive opportunity in the AI data industry. It enables smaller players like Gata to move faster, gain market share, and leapfrog slower incumbents that struggle to pivot. This is happening across the tech landscape.
