# Revenue Model

## 1. Licensing / Access Fees

Gata charges access fees to AI companies that wish to use our frontier datasets. Tiered licensing can address varying usage scopes (e.g., research, commercial, exclusive).

Datasets suitable for licensing fees include:

* **Over 5.3M Real-User ChatGPT Data**, best human-AI interaction data in the world
* **Over 106k Real-User OpenAI o1 reasoning Data**, helpful for training reasoning AI
* **Human preference data**, critical for human-AI alignment

## 2. (Co-)Development of AI Products

When Gata's unique frontier data establishes a significant competitive advantage for certain AI products, we may co-develop those products with partners or develop our own proprietary AI solutions. Revenue is generated through product sales, subscriptions, or exclusive service offerings. Additionally, we may negotiate royalties or revenue-sharing agreements for the final AI product. This approach ensures that Gata's incentives are directly aligned with the success of the AI products.

Datasets suitable for (co-)development of AI products include:

* Upcoming. Stay excited...
